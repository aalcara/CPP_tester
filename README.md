# CPP_tester
Tester for Ã©cole 42 CPP modules.

The assert.sh file is from [torokmark/assert.sh](https://github.com/torokmark/assert.sh).

This repository have some bash files to run tests on CPP modules, that I made while writing my CPP project.

Unfortunately don't wrote test for all exercises, feel free to contribute with more tests.

*** For some exercises with main.cpp I only checked if the output is the same of the subject 

## Usage

### Config

First of all, verify if the `config` has the correct path to the module to be tested.

### Run test for only one module

Run the the script with the exact same name of module:

```bash
> # to run test of CPP_Module_00
> ./module00.sh
```

### Run test for all modules

```bash
./tester.sh
```
